# Elektrosluch-DIY

This is a fork of the repository with resources for making a basic version of [Elektrosluch](https://zvukolom.org/elektrosluch) on a perfboard.

".diy" files are made in [DIY Layout creator](https://code.google.com/archive/p/diy-layout-creator/) and ".sch" files come from [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/). Downloading this software will only be necessary if you need to edit those files.

The perfboard layout was changed to fit the components at hand and a power switch was added. Additionally, a case was designed in Fusion360. The PCB and 9V battery are kept in place without any glue. Also the top and bottom of the case snap together without any screws.
